# Fuzzy Granular Balls and OPRAm for Spatial Query Answering in Uncertain Environments

## Overview

This repository contains the code and experimental results for a novel framework that integrates fuzzy granular balls with the OPRAm spatial reasoning calculus to address the problem of spatial query answering in uncertain environments. Traditional methods often fail to capture the inherent imprecision of spatial data, particularly in real-world applications dealing with noisy sensor data, imprecise location reports, or vague spatial descriptions. This framework provides a more robust and flexible solution by leveraging the strengths of both fuzzy logic and qualitative spatial reasoning.

## Key Concepts

*   **Fuzzy Granular Balls:** Spatial objects are represented as fuzzy regions, where the degree of membership reflects the level of uncertainty associated with the object's location. A Gaussian membership function is used to define the fuzzy region, with the radius of the granular ball directly related to the level of uncertainty.

*   **OPRAm Spatial Reasoning Calculus:** A qualitative spatial reasoning calculus that provides a formal framework for representing and reasoning about spatial relationships between objects. OPRAm extends the Region Connection Calculus (RCC-8) by incorporating directional information.

*   **Fuzzy OPRAm:** An adaptation of the OPRAm calculus to operate on fuzzy granular balls, defining fuzzy intersection and containment operations that enable reasoning about spatial relationships under uncertainty.

## Methodology

1.  **Fuzzy Granular Ball Representation:** Spatial objects are represented as fuzzy granular balls centered at a location `l = (x, y)` with radius `r`. The membership function `μ_B(x', y')` assigns a degree of membership to each point `(x', y')`:

    ```
    μ_B(x', y') = e^(-(d(l, (x', y'))^2) / (2σ^2))
    ```

    where `d(l, (x', y'))` is the Euclidean distance and `σ` is the standard deviation, related to the radius `r` by `r = kσ` (where `k` is a constant, typically 2).

2.  **OPRAm Adaptation:** Fuzzy intersection and containment operations are defined for fuzzy granular balls. For example, the fuzzy intersection of two fuzzy granular balls `A` and `B` is defined as:

    ```
    μ_C(x, y) = min(μ_A(x, y), μ_B(x, y))
    ```

    The fuzzy containment of `A` in `B` is defined as:

    ```
    Containment(A, B) = (∫ min(μ_A(x, y), μ_B(x, y)) dx dy) / (∫ μ_A(x, y) dx dy)
    ```

    Fuzzy versions of OPRAm relations (e.g., "north of") are defined based on these operations.

## Experimental Setup

The framework was evaluated through a series of experiments using OpenStreetMap data. The experiments were designed to assess the performance of Fuzzy OPRAm under varying conditions of noise, uncertainty, and query complexity.

### Baseline Models

The performance of Fuzzy OPRAm was compared against the following baseline models:

*   **Crisp Region Baseline:** Represents objects as crisp regions and performs spatial query answering using standard spatial operators.
*   **Probabilistic Baseline (KDE):** Employs kernel density estimation to model spatial uncertainty.
*   **GeoBERT:** A BERT model fine-tuned on spatial text.
*   **ST-Transformer:** A spatial-temporal transformer model.
*   **GNN:** A Graph Neural Network model.

### Datasets

*   **Experiment 1:** Restaurants in Gangnam, Seoul, South Korea (OpenStreetMap).  Gaussian noise added to simulate location uncertainty.
*   **Experiment 2:** Coffee shops and libraries in New York (OpenStreetMap). Angular uncertainty introduced by rotating coffee shop locations.
*   **Experiment 3:** Pharmacies, hospitals, and parks in Chicago (OpenStreetMap). Gaussian noise added to all POI locations.
*   **Experiment 4:** Reported crime locations in San Francisco (public crime database) and school locations (OpenStreetMap).  Real-world imprecise location data.
*   **Experiment 5:** Generated datasets of POIs with varying sizes (10,000 to 10,000,000 data points) and noise levels.

### Queries

Various spatial queries were used, including:

*   Distance-based queries (e.g., "Find all restaurants within 500 meters of a given hotel")
*   Direction-based queries (e.g., "Find all coffee shops north of the library")
*   Combined distance and direction queries (e.g., "Find all pharmacies within 1 km southwest of the hospital and north of the park")

### Evaluation Metrics

*   Precision
*   Recall
*   F1-score
*   Hausdorff distance
*   Directional accuracy
*   Computational time
*   Memory Usage

### Implementation

The experiments were implemented using Python 3.8, leveraging libraries such as:

*   GeoPandas
*   Shapely
*   Scikit-fuzzy
*   Scikit-learn
*   NumPy
*   SciPy
*   PyTorch
*   TensorFlow
*   Transformers
*   PyTorch Geometric
*   DGL
*   Statsmodels
*   Matplotlib
*   Seaborn

All experiments were run on a machine equipped with an Intel Xeon Gold 6248R CPU, an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU, and 128 GB of RAM, running Ubuntu 20.04.

## Results

The results of the experiments demonstrate that Fuzzy OPRAm offers a significant improvement in accuracy for spatial query answering in uncertain environments, particularly when dealing with noisy or imprecise location data.

*   **Experiment 1:** Fuzzy OPRAm consistently outperformed the Crisp Region Baseline across all noise levels. For example, at a 50m noise level, Fuzzy OPRAm achieved an F1-score of 0.82 compared to the Crisp Region Baseline's 0.60 (p < 0.01).
*   **Experiment 2:** Fuzzy OPRAm significantly outperformed the Crisp Region Baseline in terms of directional accuracy. At an angular uncertainty of 25 degrees, Fuzzy OPRAm maintained an accuracy of 10 degrees, compared to the Crisp Region Baseline's accuracy of 65 degrees (p < 0.001).
*   **Experiment 3:** Fuzzy OPRAm achieved an F1-score of 0.85, a directional accuracy of 8 degrees, and a Hausdorff distance of 75 meters, outperforming the Crisp Region Baseline (p < 0.001).
*   **Experiment 4:** All models performed relatively poorly on the real-world imprecise crime location data, indicating the challenges of handling highly complex and heterogeneous real-world datasets.
*   **Experiment 5:** Fuzzy OPRAm's computational time was higher than the Crisp Region Baseline, but the use of a spatial index (R-tree) significantly reduced the computational time. Fuzzy OPRAm scaled more gracefully than KDE for very large datasets.
